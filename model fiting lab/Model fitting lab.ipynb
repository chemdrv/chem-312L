    "## A note on how you got this file\n",
    "\n",
    "You got this file in one of two ways: you either downloaded it directly from github to your computer, or you use `nbgitpuller` to pull the repository over to your account on Chem Compute. There are also a couple of other files that need to travel along with this file. If you can't get the sample data to load below, check that you grabbed all of the files from github, not just this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to twofold:\n",
    "1. To give you the programming skills you need to fit data to a model\n",
    "2. To teach you how to decide which model is the best model for a given data set\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is split into three sections. In the first, I import raw data and clean it up for fitting. In the second, I fit the same data set to several functions, and discuss how to decide which is the best model for my data. The final section is your turn: you'll be given a data set and you'll need to fit it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the first two sections, I've already done everything. However, as you read, you'll want to interact with the code. Execute each cell, and convince yourself that you understand what it's doing. For some of them, I had to guess-and-check to find a value. In those cases, what you see is usually my final answer. You should repeat the guess-and-check on your own to see how I arrived at the place I'm in. Feel free to edit any cells you like to make sure you understand what's going on. If you want to add a cell of your own to play with, use `Insert->Insert Cell Above/Below`. The keyboard shortcut is `Esc->A` or `Esc->B`.\n",

    "#### Don't forget the help\n",
    "\n",
    "Experienced programmers spend much of their time accessing documentation. The trick here is to know what is the best way to get help. Remember that you can type `help(functionname)` in a cell and execute this cell to get inline help. I also recommend having the following documentation websites to hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions\n",
    "We're doing a lot of work with functions, both ones that you write and ones that exist. It'll be helpful to know the lingo (what is a kwarg??). This is the section in the first Python tutorial on how to write functions, and talks a lot about what goes into a function call. Also, that's the Python tutorial there. You might find it helpful to work through any parts that cover topics you're struggling with.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://matplotlib.org/index.html\n",
    "This is the documentation for matplotlib, the plotting package we're using. I like to open up the Examples, find a graph that looks like what I need, then read.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/index.html\n",
    "Numpy (numeric + python = numpy) is the library that makes Python handle numbers and data wonderfully. This is the documentation link for all of Numpy. Consider poking around the tutorials to get a general familiarity of how Numpy works. If you learn how array broadcasting works, you'll realize that Numpy is magic.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/\n",
    "In day-to-day work, a reference guide is super helpful, so this is the Numpy reference. It's worth clicking on things like \"Array creation routines\" to realize that Numpy can just *make* make of the arrays that you end up needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/optimize.html\n",
    "Scipy is a set of useful tools for scientists (scipy = science + python). This is the documentation for the optimize package, which has all of the model fitting tools we're going to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, realize that I'm showing you how to do new skills in action. It's your job to read the documentation to figure out how I'm doing what I'm doing. To get started, execute the cell below to import the libraries that you'll need, and get rolling.\n",

    "Let's break down that first line. I'm calling the `loadtxt()` function from `numpy` (abbreviated `np`). I've passed three **arguments** to the function. Arguments are the things we give a function to tell it how to behave. The first argument tells Jupyter where to look for the data file. If you saved the test data somewhere else, then you'll need to edit this line accordingly. The next argument specifies the delimeter, which is the character between each number. You don't always have to specify the delimeter, but if you know it then it's a good idea to put it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third argument gets into data handling. Go ahead and open up the data file in Excel. This file came off of the oscilloscope we're using in the laser experiments. It has a bunch of metadata in the first two columns, which tells us things like what units the data is in and what equipment did the collecting. The metadata is important to know, but not important for data processing. `loadtxt()` wants rectangular data: rows and columns all full of numbers, no gaps or words. Since the metadata is part of the first two columns, and then a gap, I want to tell `loadtxt()` to skip those first three columns, which is what `usecols=()` does. \"But Dr. V\", you say, \"why do you say to use columns 3 and 4? Shouldn't that be columns 4 and 5?\" And that'd be right...if you were in MATLAB. Python uses what's called 0 indexing, which means you start counting at 0 instead of at 1. There are a lot of reasons why, and basically it's wonderful almost all the time, once you get over the hurdle of learning to count from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, that way of importing the data is just fine, but accessing the data is a bit cludgy. Depending on how you're accessing your data, it can be nice to put the time vector as one array, and the voltage vector as another array. In the cell below, I import the data a second time, but split up the two arrays. Check the helpful on `loadtxt()` for more info, either by typing `help(np.loadtxt)` into a cell, or by going here: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html\n",

The following cell let's you adjust the data to start at a zero voltage. **What you should do:** I've started it with a value of `index` that's totally wrong. First, figure out what the lines are trying to do. Next, change that index value and re-run it. Keep adjusting the index value until you've got it averaging just the area before the steep initial rise.\n",

    "# Fitting the sample data\n",
    "\n",
    "## How fitting works\n",
    "You've all used Excel or a similar program to add on a treadline. You may or may not know the process by which that line gets generated. There's a lot of layers here, so I'm gonna give you some theory before I go ahead and do it. This whole process gets called Optimization in the programming literature. You can see the options for Scipy (the Python scientific programming library) here: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html As you can see, there are a lot of ways to approach this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A bit about linear least squares\n",
    "\n",
    "The fit method Excel uses for a linear trendline is called linear least squares. The 'least squares' part of the name refers to how we decide we have the best fit: we want to minimize the sum of the residuals squared. Let's break that down. Given a set of experimental data points $y_{obs}$, we want to calculate the set of calculated points $y_{calc}$ which best fit that data within the model we have chosen. The residuals, $r$ are the difference between the two points:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "r = y_{obs} - y_{calc}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The least squares method says we want to minimize the following quantity:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Sigma r^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We're saying that the line of best fit has the overall smallest differences between that line and the experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'linear' part in the least squares name has nothing to do with only fitting lines. Rather, it's any function form that is linear with the fit parameters, that is, each fit parameter can be multiplied by an function of x. For example, the equation below is linear with respect to parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$, so it can be fit using linear least squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "ax + bx^2 + c \\sin(x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out the linear least squares problem is analytically solveable: there is one unique solution for any data set and model combination. You can solve it with paper and pencil using some matrix algebra. No one actually does that outside of math classes, but you could, if you felt motivated. Realistically, outside of very small problems for illustration of the concept, everyone uses a computerized fitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taking it further: The search algorithm\n",

    "More complicated functional forms and larger data sets tend to demand actual search functions. These are functions that do a guess-and-check routine, often with some randomness, and a fair bit of calculus thrown in, to attempt to find the minimum of some function. Why minimum? You set up the problem to define the difference between the model fit and the experimental data, and then attempt to minimize the difference between them. Usually this is the sum of the residuals squared. To visualize what's happening, take a look at the figure below:\n",

    "The y-axis on this graph is the function we're trying to minimize, the difference between the model data and our data. The computer is trying to find the global minimum, but it doesn't know the surface. The computer starts at some point and starts walking. Each step it picks a set of parameters, calculates $\\Sigma r^2$, and compares with the previous value. Then, based on the algorithm, it decides a new set of parameters, and repeats. The goal, for this graph, would be to find the set of parameters corresponding to point `A`.\n",

    "You can imagine that where you start is really important. If you start searching at point `D`, it's pretty easy to fall downhill and hit the global minmum. If you start at point `C`, it's much harder. There's that deep well at point `B` between your original starting point and the real answer. This is why sometimes it's helpful to give an initial guess at the paramters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another complication is the number of axies. I've drawn one paramter axis, but really, there are as many search axes as there are parmeters. This means that, for a linear fit, the computer can decide to take a step along the slope axis, or along the y-intercept axis, or diagonally and change both. Models with more parameters, therefore, tend to take longer to fit, as well as sometimes running into problems finding a minimum value.\n",

Nelder-Mead and nonlinear-conjugate-gradient are two that Scipy can handle. If you don't know enough to know how to pick them, don't worry. Just go with the default, but keep it in your head that some of these althorithms are specalized, and if you can't get a weird data set to fit, maybe you should learn about different algorithms.\n",

I usually have one or two that I remember how to use, and learn new ones as I need them. We're going to use the `curve_fit` function. This function lets us define any functional form, lets us put in uncertainty on the data, and gives us the covariance matrix (more on that below), so it's pretty spiffy.

As we're scientists, we want our data to have physical meaning whenever possible. So I'm going to start by hoping that my sample data is best fit to a decaying exponential.

    "\n",
    "You're welcome to chat with your classmates as you work. Actually, that's encouraged. We've got a whole space in Webex just for programming talk. Ask your questions, answer questions, rant about your difficulties. But at the end of the assignment, you should be turning in your own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "I will put the video file(s) in the class shared Google Drive folder, which is linked on Blackboard, probably in more than one location. I will also extract frames from one of the video files and post them in the shared folder. You'll need to either watch the video or step through the still frames and get foam volume at each time.\n",

    " - This is as much an exercise in self orginization as a class as it is in your experimental abilities\n",
    " - Consider how to record the volumes. The measurement device is graduated in 25mL increments but is upside down. There is also some head space that I have not measured, though you're welcome to do so.\n",
    " - Probably don't obesses too much, just try to think carefully about it as you go.\n",

    "\n",
    "You're going to turn in your Jupyter notebook, but clean it up first. The top section of your notebook should be your data import, showing any work you needed to do to get the data ready to fit. Next, show me a fit you rejected that's not totally implausible, but that you rejected. I need to see the raw data, your fit, a residuals plot, and a representation of parameter error. Then discuss how this information caused you to reject the model. Finally, show me your final choice model fit. I need to see the raw data, your fit, residuals, and parameter error. Discuss why this is your best choice for a fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should make this notebook easy for me to follow. That means you're going to need to comment as you go, and make the plots pretty enough for me to read. There is no need to obsess, but consider if an axis label, legend, or zoom is necessary for me to see what you want me to see. You're also going to need to type plain text describing what you did, just like the cell I'm typing in right now. These cells are called **markdown** cells. You can convert a cell to markdown using the drop down menu at the top of a notebook, or by pressing escape (so the side of the cell turns blue) and then pressing `m`. Your discussion of fits should be done in markdown cells. You may add any extra markdown cells needed to make your notebook easy for me to follow.\n",
